# OLEXI Extension — Privacy Policy

Effective: 14 August 2025

- The OLEXI Extension does not collect or store your personal data, browsing history, prompts, or research results.
- The extension does not store any API keys. Only minimal UI settings may be stored locally in the browser.
- Requests are sent to an Olexi Host you control (by default running locally). The host may involve third‑party services to fulfil your request:
  - Google Gemini (if configured) for planning and summarisation
  - AustLII (austlii.edu.au) for legal search results
- We are not responsible for what is collected by third‑party services (including Gemini and AustLII). Their terms and privacy policies apply.
- The extension does not send analytics or telemetry.
- If you deploy the Olexi Host, it may keep minimal operational logs for rate limiting and security; this is under your control.

For questions, open an issue in the repository.
